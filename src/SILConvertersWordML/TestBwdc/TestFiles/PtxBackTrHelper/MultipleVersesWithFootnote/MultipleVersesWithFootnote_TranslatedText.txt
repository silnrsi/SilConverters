Therefore, respect them with love for this ministry of theirs. 
Brothers and sisters, we also ask that you reconcile among yourselves in the Church. Warn those who have become lazy to work hard to earn their daily bread. Encourage those who are afraid. Help those who are weak. Continue to patiently care for all.
